									<h2>Who am I?</h2>

									<p>I'm Emilia Zabrzanska, a Maths and Physics graduate with a First Class Honours degree and a current MPhil student in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge. 
									My academic path has given me strong foundations in problem-solving, scientific computing, and data analysis, which I enjoy applying to research, coding challenges, and real-world problem solving.
									</p>

									<p>Alongside my studies, I have professional experience in training, operations, and leadership. 
									As an NPLQ Trainer Assessor and GLL Duty Manager, I've delivered accredited lifeguard training, and managed swim schools and daily operations across leisure centres. 
									These roles have developed my ability to lead teams, manage logistics, and maintain high standards in safety and compliance, skills I believe are transferable to both research and industry.
									</p>

									<p>I also have a growing interest in web development and scientific programming. 
									Recent projects include building a full-stack React/Firebase revision app and carrying out exoplanet transit photometry analysis using Python and HOPS. 
									I enjoy working on projects that combine technical detail with practical application, whether that's streamlining operations, analysing astrophysical data, or creating tools that make learning easier.
									</p>

									<p>Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a PhD after completing my MPhil at Cambridge, with the goal of exploring how artificial intelligence can be integrated into lifesaving and lifeguarding technology. 
									I am particularly interested in developing systems that can support critical decision-making in unpredictable environments such as swimming pools and open water. 
									By combining my academic background in data-intensive science with my professional experience in aquatic safety and training, I aim to contribute research that not only advances AI but also has a real-world impact on safety, prevention, and community wellbeing.
									</p>

									<p>Outside of work and study, I enjoy swimming, martial arts, and exploring creative projects, from art and design to personal coding side projects. 
									I thrive in roles where I can combine curiosity, structure, and collaboration, and I'm always looking for the next challenge that will help me grow further.
									</p>
